# Seraph App Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to address the app launch issues with the Seraph app.

## Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate Model Views**: There were duplicate declarations of `ModelSelectorView` in both `ModelSelectorView.swift` and in `ChatView.swift`.

2. **Unresolved Dependencies**: Several views were referencing custom styles and components that were not properly imported or available.

3. **Inconsistent Service Initialization**: The application was inconsistently creating and using OllamaService instances instead of using the shared singleton.

4. **Broken UI Components**: Several components were referencing missing theme styles or had incorrect layouts.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Simplified Service Access**:
   - Consistently used `OllamaService.shared` throughout the app
   - Updated the ChatViewModel initialization to use the default shared service

2. **Fixed UI Components**:
   - Moved ModelSelectorView from ChatView.swift to its own file in Components directory
   - Updated ConnectionStatusView to use standard SwiftUI components instead of custom theme
   - Fixed ModelRowView to be properly reused in the ModelSelectorView

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced token counting and formatting
   - Fixed application initialization flow

4. **Build Fixes**:
   - Resolved duplicate type definitions
   - Fixed missing component references
   - Simplified UI structure for more reliable building

## Next Steps

1. Launch the app and verify that it connects to Ollama properly
2. Test the token counter with real Ollama models
3. Verify that code blocks render correctly
4. Test the connection monitoring and model selection functionality

## Notes

The main issue preventing the app from launching appeared to be related to how the views were structured and how services were initialized. By ensuring consistent use of the singleton pattern and resolving duplicate view definitions, we've addressed the core issues that were preventing the app from launching.
